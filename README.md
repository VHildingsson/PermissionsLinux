<h1>Correct File Permissions in Linux Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Tasks completed during project</h2>

- Permission string “drwxrwxrwx” explained
- Removed writing access for other on the project_k.txt file
- Modified permissions for user and group on the hidden .project_x.txt file to ensure read access and remove write permissions
